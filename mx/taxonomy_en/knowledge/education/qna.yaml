      This curricular proposal is structured with the following four elements:
      1. Curricular integration, which enables interdisciplinary work based on the problematization of reality and the development of projects where the contents considered fundamental intervene, which are organized in formative fields and articulating axes. In this way, a comprehensive education is promoted that places the educational processes in the context of which the school is a part.
      2. Professional autonomy of teachers, to make decisions regarding the contextualization of the contents of the study programs, according to the social, territorial, cultural, and educational reality of the students.
      3. The community as an integrating nucleus of teaching and learning processes, and of the school's relationships with society, where knowledge, values, norms, cultures, and forms of coexistence are built and shared.
      4. The human right to education of students as a priority of the National Educational System.

      Curricular integration in, from, and with diversities. In basic education, the PPE (Study Plans and Programs) of recent decades privileged a structure based on the disciplinary fragmentation of knowledge, divided into curricular spaces that had no contact with each other. This structure made it difficult to integrate, appropriate, and deepen knowledge and learning in the teaching and learning processes, in addition to making their connection with the experiences of children, adolescents, and teachers complex.
      On the other hand, certain curricular spaces were prioritized with an inequitable distribution of teaching time; for example, since 2004, in preschool, the greatest emphasis in teaching time was on Language and Communication. In primary and secondary schools, the predominant subjects since 1993 were Spanish and Mathematics, with the highest number of weekly and annual teaching hours compared to the rest of the subjects. This preference was legitimized with the implementation of standardized evaluations and the social pressure exerted by families and educational authorities.

      - question: What type of curricular structure was favored with the PPE in recent decades?
        answer: In recent decades, a structure based on the disciplinary fragmentation of knowledge was favored, divided into curricular spaces that had no contact with each other.
      - question: Why were these curricular structures considered problematic for the teaching and learning process?
        answer: These structures made it difficult to integrate, appropriate, and deepen knowledge and learning in the teaching and learning processes.
      - question: Which subjects experienced an inequitable distribution of teaching time according to the text?
        answer: Subjects such as Spanish and Mathematics, which predominated since 1993 in primary and secondary schools, received a greater number of weekly and annual teaching hours compared to the rest of the subjects.
